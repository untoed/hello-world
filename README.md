# hello-world
My Goal is to discover my own language.
A language that can interpret my perception of reality.
A language unlimited by neither physical or virtual realms, as long as invariable creation is possible.
Ideas are dreadful, yet plentiful. 
Dreams are intangible, so restful sleep is nigh.
Yet, a human's mind only sleeps to convey physical recovery, not mental health as residual as could be. 
My surreal ambitions should not have been left to unconquerable dreams. 
As far as physics will upstand my usurped limitations, my dreams are beyond the greatest of ambitions. 
To adaptably change a dying planet with unbeknownst, yet irreversible effects.
Allow my virtual realities to materialize from its unfortunate mentality.
